        "a function $f(x)$ across a defined interval $[a,b]$. To achieve this, the interval is divided into a numerical grid of $n+1$ points, separated by a distance $h=\\frac{b-a}{n}$, creating subintervals between each pair of points. The task involves approximating the area under the curve $f(x)$ for each subinterval by using shapes whose areas can be easily calculated, and then summing up these individual areas to approximate the total integral $\\int_{a}^{b} f(x) dx$. The approach assumes that the function $f(x)$ can be evaluated at any point on the grid or is given in terms of $f(x_i)$ for the grid points.The interval $[x_i,x_{i+1}]$ is referred to as a subinterval."

        "Riemann Integral as a basic technique for approximating integrals, where the integral of a function $f(x)$ over an interval $[a,b]$ is approximated by summing the areas of rectangles within each subinterval of the partition. The width of each rectangle is $h$(the distance between consecutive points $x_i$ and $x_{i+1}$), and the height is determined by the function value at a specific point within the subinterval, typically the left or right endpoint. This method yields two formulas for the Riemann Integral approximation, depending on whether the left or right endpoint is used for the height of the rectangles.\n",

It concludes that the error in the Riemann Integral approximation is $O(h^2)$ for a single subinterval, and when summed over the entire interval, the total error is $O(h)$, indicating that the accuracy of the approximation improves linearly with smaller h.\n",
